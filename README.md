# Bloc

### See this live at: https://juliajessica.github.io/bloc/

Bloc is a webpage designed to share creative design inspirations by Julia Sheremet and Jessica Schmitz. The idea for bloc was curated to help local businesses thrive. We developed a single page application where PDX businesses can share their shop information and gain an extra backlink to their site.
